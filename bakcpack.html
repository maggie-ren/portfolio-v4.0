                                <p>Parent shaming has become so prevalent in recent years that it’s been making headlines. Who hasn’t had their child-rearing choices questioned by family and friends maybe even an ex-spouse and their new partner? 
                                    Unsolicited ‘advice’ or ‘suggestions’ have a way of creeping into your psyche promoting shame where it once was not. Several articles state that specifically working parents struggle to keep up with all of their work life balance, child-rearing demands, specifically their children’s education, and is compounded with each additional child.

                                <p>Parents with young children have high anxiety about missing out on announcements, permission slips, missing assignments, and other important school events.

                                    Parents need a balanced and simplified way to be alerted about future assignments, important school events and student safety because having a structured agenda allows them to properly plan more family time and feel more secure when their children is out of reach.

                                    How might we create a platform that allows an easy way for parents to be notified about personal information regarding their children that will ease their anxiety?

                                <p>We believe if a parent is able to readily access up-to-date school information, a child’s opportunity for educational success dramatically improves.

                                    Providing parents with a clear, organized, way to view and participate in their child’s education (real-time) allowing for direct feedback with teachers will reduce parental anxiety and connect parent(s) to child(ren) while improving overall home stability.

                                <p> From this research, we’ve consolidated a user persona, Leia Kingston, a divorced mother of two wonderful kids. Her work life keeps her busy, but her kids keep her even busier. Between work and kids, Leia can feel disorganized and overwhelmed with keeping track of her kids and fears that she is insufficient as a parent. We believe with our application, Backpack, we can alleviate her anxieties and allow for Leia to worry less about keeping her children’s academic matters orderly and in place. Instead she can spend more time with her kids. User persona also can help us to define a user insight and the problem statement.

A challenge we faced was expanding on certain features like “Today” being slightly broad. We solved this issue by adding in a “Daily activities” and “School Events” button on the dashboard so that users have more insight on what to navigate. This also made the app more interactive.
